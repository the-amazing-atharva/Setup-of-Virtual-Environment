## Workflow to Work on Your Streamlit Project

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Start your command prompt (cmd).

2. **Change Directory to Your Project**:
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to your project directory:
     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\project
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - Activate your virtual environment:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Open Visual Studio Code**:
   - You can now open VS Code from the command prompt by typing:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```
   - This command opens the current directory in VS Code.

5. **Code Your Project**:
   - Make your changes or write your code in VS Code.

6. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   - In the terminal inside VS Code (or in the command prompt), run your Streamlit app:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

7. **Deactivate When Finished**:
   - After you’re done testing or coding, go back to your command prompt and deactivate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```
